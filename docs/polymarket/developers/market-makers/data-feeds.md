# Data Feeds

Real-time and historical data sources for market makers

## Overview

Market makers need fast, reliable data to price markets and manage inventory. Polymarket provides several data feeds at different latency and detail levels.

| Feed | Latency | Use Case | Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WebSocket | ~100ms | Standard MM operations | Public |
| Gamma API | ~1s | Market metadata, indexing | Public |
| Onchain | Block time | Settlement, resolution | Public |

## WebSocket Feeds

The WebSocket API provides real-time market data with low latency. This is sufficient for most market making strategies.

### Connecting

```
const ws = new WebSocket("wss://ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com/ws/market");

ws.onopen = () => {
  // Subscribe to orderbook updates
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: "market",
    assets_ids: [tokenId]
  }));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  // Handle orderbook update
};
```

### Available Channels

| Channel | Message Types | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `market` | `book`, `price_change`, `last_trade_price` | [Market Channel](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/websocket/market-channel) |
| `user` | Order fills, cancellations | [User Channel](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/websocket/user-channel) |

### User Channel (Authenticated)

Monitor your order activity in real-time:

```
// Requires authentication
const userWs = new WebSocket("wss://ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com/ws/user");

userWs.onopen = () => {
  userWs.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: "user",
    auth: {
      apiKey: "your-api-key",
      secret: "your-secret",
      passphrase: "your-passphrase"
    },
    markets: [conditionId] // Optional: filter to specific markets
  }));
};

userWs.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  // Handle order fills, cancellations, etc.
};
```

See [WebSocket Authentication](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/websocket/wss-auth) for auth details.

### Best Practices

1. **Reconnection logic** \- Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
2. **Heartbeats** \- Respond to ping messages to maintain connection
3. **Local orderbook** \- Maintain a local copy and apply incremental updates
4. **Sequence numbers** \- Track sequence to detect missed messages

See [WebSocket Overview](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/websocket/wss-overview) for complete documentation.

## Gamma API

The Gamma API provides market metadata and indexing. Use it for:

- Market titles, slugs, categories
- Event/condition mapping
- Volume and liquidity data
- Outcome token metadata

### Get Markets

```
const response = await fetch(
  "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?active=true"
);
const markets = await response.json();
```

### Get Events

```
const response = await fetch(
  "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=us-presidential-election"
);
const event = await response.json();
```

### Key Fields for MMs

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `conditionId` | Unique market identifier |
| `clobTokenIds` | Outcome token IDs |
| `outcomes` | Outcome names |
| `outcomePrices` | Current outcome prices |
| `volume` | Trading volume |
| `liquidity` | Current liquidity |
| `rfqEnabled` | Whether RFQ is enabled for this market |

See [Gamma API Overview](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/gamma-markets-api/overview) for complete documentation.

## Onchain Data

For settlement, resolution, and position tracking, market makers may query onchain data directly.

### Data Sources

| Data | Source | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token balances | ERC1155 `balanceOf` | Position tracking |
| Resolution | UMA Oracle events | Pre-resolution risk modeling |
| Condition resolution | CTF contract | Post-resolution redemption |

### RPC Providers

Common providers for Polygon:

- Alchemy
- QuickNode
- Infura

### UMA Oracle

Markets are resolved via UMA’s Optimistic Oracle. Monitor resolution events for risk management. See [Resolution](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/resolution/UMA) for details on the resolution process.
