# Gamma Structure

Gamma provides some organizational models. These include events, and markets. The most fundamental element is always markets and the other models simply provide additional organization.

# Detail

1. **Market**   1. Contains data related to a market that is traded on. Maps onto a pair of clob token ids, a market address, a question id and a condition id
2. **Event**   1. Contains a set of markets
2. Variants:
      1. Event with 1 market (i.e., resulting in an SMP)
      2. Event with 2 or more markets (i.e., resulting in an GMP)
